The game of selling numbers is truly amusing. I couldn't help but laugh, reflecting on how it manipulates human psychology.

He said, “So, what’s next? Phone with five cameras? ,” and I laughed so hard.

It began with our discussion on how increasing numbers influence human psychology. A few years ago, a new entrant in mobile technology, with a limited user base, had to compete with established giants. This company devised a clever strategy: selling numbers instead of technology. They marketed their products with numerical specifications, and it proved effective. Phones with multiple cameras, higher RAM, and higher screen resolutions were promoted. As these numbers were presented to consumers, it revealed their deep-seated desire for quantity. Everyone became obsessed with 'higher is better,' and as the numbers increased, so did our desires.

Fast forward a few years, and everyone in the market is simply selling numbers. The artistry has lost its appeal, and now it's all about numerical adjustments.

The days when technology focused on innovation, artistry, and beautiful research are gone. Now, we must adapt to a world of numbers.

The way everything is advertised is quite amusing. While there's nothing inherently wrong with it, it's simply how the market operates, and everyone succumbed to the clever strategy of selling numbers.
