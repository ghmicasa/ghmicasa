title: How communication fails.

During communication, either people speak different languages and meanings are lost in the translation, or they communicate in the same language but meanings differ. Let me rephrase the question: "Is it possible to transfer the true fragrance of thoughts from one individual to another?"

Communication happens because we've devised a system of common reference points to transfer thoughts. These reference points develop over time, and each individual solidifies their own unique structure. Ask this: "Are these structures similar, or more precisely, identical?" For this to occur, individuals would have to be confined to the same space from birth, which is impossible. Therefore, true communication is never fully achieved. The speaker provides information based on their developed structure, and the listener receives it based on theirs, and these structures are not the same.

Is it a hopeless situation? No. Knowing this, telling the truth becomes vital for the true fragrance of thoughts to be transferred, for communication to continue. When I speak of truth, I refer not to universal truth, but to localized or momentary truth.
