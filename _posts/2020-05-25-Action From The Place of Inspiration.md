title: Inspiration Vs Judgement.
description: Sometimes we judge ourselves too harshly because of the situation which didn’t come to fruition as we desired, and this leads us to a maze with no exit. The endless questioning and answering, going in circles, leads us to a nowhere land. The nowhere barren land.

Sometimes we judge ourselves too harshly because of the situation which didn’t come to fruition as we desired, and this leads us to a maze with no exit. The endless questioning and answering, going in circles, leads us to a nowhere land. The nowhere barren land.

No matter how much water you give, nothing will germinate on this land. The longer you wander this land, the more exhausted you'll feel. This arid land has seen many men thirsted to death. Are you willing to take such risk?

Don’t walk a path where nothing exists. Actions should stem from the place of inspiration, not harsh judgement. Let inspiration be your source; inspire yourself to achieve your destiny.
