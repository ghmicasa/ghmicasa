Why plants are the highest form of conscious life?

I hope some have taken the time to decode the mysteries of this world beyond surface appearances.

Let's begin with the human perspective: "These plants and trees are life forms that exist on this planet devoid of consciousness. The fruit hanging from the tree is here to provide us with food, not only to satisfy our hunger but also to delight our palate."

Now, let's consider the perspective of the plants and trees: "To survive and reproduce, I must devise a strategy that serves not only my purpose but also that of others. Therefore, I will encase my offspring in a delectable pulp. These animals will obtain sustenance and, unknowingly, assist in the dispersal of my seed. I will also protect the seed with a hard shell, as these creatures sometimes lack restraint in their consumption."

Finally, let's hear from nature: "You are all my children, and I am aware of everything. Plants, being the most resilient and consciously advanced, must thrive even in the harshest environments, where other life forms cannot endure, and sustain the natural ecosystem."

In conclusion, I urge you to consider all possible viewpoints.
