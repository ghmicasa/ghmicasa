    content:  Maa Shailputri is the first form of Goddess Durga and is worshipped on the first day. Her name literally means "daughter of the mountain." Often, the name and the artistic depictions embody the essence associated with these energies. Being a daughter of the mountain, what does it symbolize? <br/>Mountains, metaphorically, can have many meanings in the spiritual realm. They represent aesthetic meanings of stability, such as symmetry, reliability, balance, strength, resilience, endurance, etc. This symbolism, for the disciple, hints towards the idea that is to be observed.

Today marks the commencement of Chaitra Navratri, a sacred nine day festival dedicated to Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms. These nine forms are associated with the multifaceted energies of divine feminine, which permeates the universe.

The "will"¹, the divine masculine, acting upon the divine feminine, is bound to produce whatever is willed. The interplay of these energies is the source of all creation. The divine masculine, like the divine feminine, is present everywhere in the universe. Both these energies are omnipresent. The purpose of Navratri is to cleanse oneself by recognizing the divine feminine present within each of us and engage in the process of self purification. By allowing the masculine and feminine to interact, the process of positive creation within ourselves begins.

These energies, which create all things around us and within us, including oneself, are transcendental in nature. Let goodness prevail within you, and it becomes the source from which your "will"¹ emanates. By recognizing these energies as they are—as having a nature that transcends human imagination, being present in all, and connecting all—it shall bring the fruit of oneness for you and everyone.
