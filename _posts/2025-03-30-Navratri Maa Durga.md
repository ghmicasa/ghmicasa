  - title: Day 1 - Devoted to Maa Shailputri
    content: Maa Shailputri is the first form of Goddess Durga and is worshipped on the first day. Her name literally means "daughter of the mountain." Often, the name and the artistic depictions embody the essence associated with these energies. Being a daughter of the mountain, what does it symbolize?<br/><br/>Mountains, metaphorically, can have many meanings in the spiritual realm. They represent aesthetic meanings of stability, such as symmetry, reliability, balance, strength, resilience, endurance, etc. This symbolism, for the disciple, hints towards the idea that is to be observed.
  - title: Day 2 - Devoted to Maa Brahmacharini
    content: Maa Brahmacharini is the second form of Goddess Durga and is observed on the second day. The name literally means “the one whose conduct is consistent with the idea of Brahman.”<br/><br/>The idea of Brahman, as explained in Adi Shankaracharya's Advaita Vedanta, is the ultimate reality or truth which is indescribable in words, or more precisely, in Shankaracharya’s own words, “Brahman is the ultimate, formless, and attributeless reality.” To observe Brahman, and to distinguish it from Maya, which is generally observed by human senses, is performed on this day. After the first day, where stability and strength are symbolized, on the second day, the disciple is asked to filter out the essential and non-essential elements.
  - title: Day 3 - Devoted to Maa Chandraghanta
    content: Maa Chandraghanta is the third form of Goddess Durga and is observed on the third day. The name literally translates to Chandra (Moon) and Ghanta (Bell). In the artistic depictions, she is depicted as a Goddess with a third eye.<br/><br/>The moon has always been associated with the inner world in the spiritual and esoteric world, and the bell is used to invoke the deities. Here, on the third day, the disciple is asked to invoke the inner world.
  - title: Day 4 - Devoted to Maa Kushmanda
    content: The fourth form of Goddess Durga is Maa Kushmanda. Her name translates to “little warmth of cosmic egg.”<br/><br/>On the fourth day, after observing three days, the disciple understands what their higher self is asking of them in their present worldly form. The cosmic egg symbolizes the fruit of the inner world.
  - title: Day 5 - Devoted to Maa Skandamata
    content: Maa Skandamata represents the nurturing aspect of the divine mother. She is the fifth form of Goddess Durga. Her name translates to “mother of Lord Kartikeya.”<br/><br/>Lord Kartikeya embodies the idea of courage and valor and is depicted as one who rides a peacock, symbolizing the subjugation of pride and ego. Adding another layer of mother over such symbolism is giving much-needed answers to the disciple on the fifth day of Navratri.
  - title: Day 6 - Devoted to Maa Katyayani
    content: The sixth day is devoted to Maa Katyayani. This form of Goddess Durga is associated with the idea of rigorous penance and devotion. In the artistic form, she is displaying Abhaya² and Varada³ Mudras⁴.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Sage Katyayana, who devoted himself to intense worship of Goddess Durga. Goddess Durga, pleased with his devotion, granted the sage his wish and manifested herself as his daughter. The symbolism of intense worship, and energy manifesting as a daughter, indicates the disciple's progress. From stability to understanding, to probing, to the divine egg, to the divine feminine, to divine birth.
  - title: Day 7 - Devoted to Maa Kalaratri
    content: The seventh form of Goddess Durga is Maa Kalaratri, observed on the seventh day. The name translates to “the night of death.” She symbolizes the destruction of ignorance and removal of darkness. Often depicted with flames coming from her nostrils.<br/><br/>From the seventh day onwards, the self and divine energies intertwine, oneness is observed, and the darkest corners are cleansed.
  - title: Day 8 - Devoted to Maa Mahagauri
    content: The eighth day is devoted to Maa Mahagauri, the eighth form of Goddess Durga. The name Mahagauri translates to “supreme white or fair.” She symbolizes purity, serenity, and tranquility.<br/><br/>The disciple is in sync with the energies of the universe and is ready for the interplay of the divine masculine and feminine.
  - title: Day 9 - Devoted to Maa Siddhidatri
    content: On the final day, the ninth day, Goddess Durga's form is Maa Siddhidatri. The name translates to “bestowed with Siddhi⁵.” She symbolizes the attainment of spiritual fulfillment.<br/><br/>The Navratri festival culminates on this day.

Today marks the commencement of Chaitra Navratri, a sacred nine-day festival dedicated to Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms. These nine forms are associated with the multifaceted energies of the divine feminine that permeate the universe.

The "will"¹, the divine masculine, acting upon the divine feminine, is certain to produce what is willed. The interplay of these energies is the source of all creation. The divine masculine, like the divine feminine, is present everywhere in the universe. Both energies are omnipresent. The purpose of Navratri is to cleanse oneself by recognizing the divine feminine present within each of us and engage in the process of self-purification. By allowing the masculine and feminine to interact, the process of positive creation within ourselves begins.

These energies, which create all things around us and within us, including oneself, are transcendental in nature. Let goodness prevail within you, and it will become the source from which your "will"¹ emanates. By recognizing these energies as they are—as having a nature that transcends human imagination, being present in all and connecting all things—it shall bring the fruit of oneness for you and everyone.
