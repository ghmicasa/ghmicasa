title: Whirlpool of self-deception.
description: We all encounter situations we dislike, experiences that clash with our personal beliefs. For me, that concept is duality.

We all encounter situations we dislike, experiences that clash with our personal beliefs. For me, that concept is duality. While duality itself is not inherently wrong, it is a personal preference that currently eludes my comprehension. Perhaps I may embrace it in the future, but for now, it remains a point of contention.

Consider the phenomenon of self-deception. We are presented with a superficial image, while a deeper reality exists beneath the surface. Through self-deception, we create a perfect duality. This self-deception is so potent that it becomes nearly impossible to dispel. It may only dissolve in our final moments, or perhaps not at all. Regardless, once ensnared in this whirlpool of deception, an individual's life becomes a testament to duality. The reasons for this entrapment remain elusive, possibly stemming from greed, insecurity, ego, or a combination thereof. Whatever the cause, it exerts a powerful hold. As life progresses, individuals often seek further self-deception to avoid confronting this reality, frequently turning to spirituality. This self-deceptive whirlpool always finds means to feed the underlying greed, the greed that supports the deception.

Have you ever encountered such a life? Or do you find yourself caught within this very whirlpool?
