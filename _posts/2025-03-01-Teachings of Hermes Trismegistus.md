title: Teachings of Hermes Trismegistus.
description: During communication, either two people speak different languages and meanings are lost in translation, or two people communicate in the same language but meaning differs. Let me rephrase the question, “Is it possible to transfer true fragrance of thoughts from one individual to another?”

Hermes Trismegistus, the thrice greatest, a legendary figure, a man with great knowledge and wisdom.

<h3><u>Prelude:</u></h3>
<br>
A little background before I go into the some of the principles, knowledge and the wisdom he taught through his teachings.

After readings philosophies of Indian subcontinent and Western world, I was left wondering and craving for more. The idea of spiritualism always attracted to me, but without rationalism, some of the ideas that were taught were hard to swallow. This is how I reached Hermeticism as I journeyed though books, I started reading hermetic principles. It kept me grounded to spiritualism with rationalism, provided practices which were easy to follow, and open doors of places which were distant earlier. Theories in spiritualism, which at times felt like some bogus ideas built on fantasies, weren’t stories any more, but some authentic experiences, which were tangible in nature. 

How I reached there? Hard to pin point, but one timeline does come to my mind. I was reading Adi Shankaracharya philosophy, loaded with heavy rationality, the tapestry of intellectual arguments are very well woven and presented. Intrigued, this made me move towards another philosophy, the philosophy of Madhvacharya, I moved from advaitvad to dvaitvad. I further moved, and got hold of Shri Aurobindo philosophy, the concept of super mind appealed, with little to no knowledge to experience it. Five senses remained shut, although I started to get feel of it, may be the sixth sense, which is intangible in nature. The feel had its tentacles connected to philosophies of Adi Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, and all the philosophies that I read before them. This, in my view, is ground work for mind. Moving forward, when I was reading Shri Aurobindo, I got hold of Mother, Mirra Alfassa, and from there, I think, I entered into reading about Hermeticism, the theories and the practices. This is when something found me, or got hold of me, I didn’t know back then, but I did later. I got found when I started reading about the Hermetic movement going on in the west. Here I came to experience the work of Max Theon, and Alma Theon, and the brotherhood of Luxor. I also read about the parallel movement of Madame Blavatsky, Theosophical society of New York. All I can say, they all introduced me to teacher Hermes Trismegistus. This is how I entered into a completely different universe, world never experienced before.

Note: During 18th and 19th century when the movements were active, when the literary works were being published, I found polar opposite movements trying to prove themselves to be better than other. Possibly why, Madame Blavatsky became target of web created through convoluted minds dwelling in unnecessary space of conflicts. Avoid that, otherwise you’ll end-up dwelling in abyss of nonsense. As a final thought, before I wrap-up introduction, Hermes Trismegistus, may find you draped in Indian women attire. He is mythical and mystical in nature. Don’t assign the gender, nationality, or the name, just think of him as something fluid that transcends characterization. 

<h3><u>The Teachings:</u></h3>
<br>
These are taken from the book The Kybalion. I am taking it from them, the three initiates. They have done wonderful work. I’ll add further flavours when necessary/needed in my future writings, but as of now, they have laid down the principles perfectly.

<blockquote id="bq">“The principles of the truth are seven, he who understands, possesses the magic key to the temple doors.”</blockquote>

<h4>1. The principle of Mentalism</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“The all is mind; the universe is mind.”</blockquote>

This principle is preparation of mind for the mental transmutation. This is done primarily in the mind, but also experienced as outward manifestation in the material world. As the process of alchemy is applied on thought/mind, the immediate chemistry of the body changes. The philosophies, I talked earlier, were the cause of changes occurring in mind, process of alchemy, and body producing dopamine, wanting to read more, finding practices, is the change of chemistry in the body. I used this example, because it is the immediate effect that can be registered. Others follow as well.

The above paragraph is all about mental transmutation. The principle, however, is talking about the mind which is different from usual definition of mind. It is all because of the limitations of words and sentences to describe something which is hard to describe in true sense, but is felt completely. Just like the goosebumps you experience while listening to music, the mild wave that travels through spinal chord is hard to describe, but is felt completely. Think of the work done by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the limitations of language. Now, this is how I’ll put it, there is one to one correspondence between the words ALL, MIND and UNIVERSE in the principle. Facets of the same phenomenon, reminding me of oneness. This ALL is super mind, or call it spirit or call it God or label it whatever, the point is, Universe is the outward manifestation of the All in the mind of the All, and the mind is in the All, which itself is in the mind of All. I know this sounds like word jargon, think of it as same thing, broken into different words to explain something. I’ll make it easy, it’s dream of GOD, who himself is in his dream. 

<h4>2. The principle of correspondence</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“As above, so below; as below, so above.”</blockquote>

This principle connects all the planes of existence, and the continuity existing between them. It is saying what is happening in one plane is happening in all planes. All the principles so described works in the same manner in all the planes. The vibrations, the next principle, differentiates or creates this division, this division is not discrete, but is continues in nature.  


<h4>3. The principle of Vibration</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“Nothing rests, everything moves, everything vibrates.”</blockquote>

This principle is all about the energy carried by states or planes. The differentiating factor talked about in the preceding principle. The continues hierarchy it establishes. Hence, who understands this principle understands the sector of power. 

<h4>4. The Principle of Polarity</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“Everything is dual, everything has poles, everything has its pair.”</blockquote>

This principle is about the extreme poles of the existence. Though the extreme poles are described, but like the earlier principles, this is also not discrete, but there is continuity, there are many states of varying degrees connecting the extreme poles.

<h4>5. The principle of Rhythm</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“The measure of the swing to the right is measure of the swing to the left.”</blockquote>

This principle is testimony of the fact that law of compensation is at work. Whatever is experienced is compensated. The lower you go, the higher you’ll bounce to the other extreme, the tendency of pendulum to swing is always there. Think of it as rubber band effect.  

<h4>6. The principle of Cause and Effect</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“Everything cause has its effects, and every effect has its cause.”</blockquote>

This is principle of causation. Its a well know principle. Here it is talking about everything is moved by some cause, it may not be evident sometimes, the chain of causes leading up to the effect, which itself can be cause for the effect still to manifest, may not be easily decoded, but always exists.  

<h4>7. The principle of Gender</h4>

<blockquote id="bq">“Gender is in everything, everything has its masculine and feminine principle.”</blockquote>

This principle describes existence of masculine and feminine element. Just like the mind had different definition in the first principle of Mentalism, the definition of feminity and masculinity is not to be confused with males and females, its just one aspect of material plane. It is about the process of creation. Here the masculine acts and the feminine is bound to produce. Think of masculine as the will and the feminine as the ground where creation has to happen.
