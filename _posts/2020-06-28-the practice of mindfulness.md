Thoughts are powerful. The thought of winning a race triggers an adrenaline rush, a tangible physical response. When these thoughts permeate from the conscious to the subconscious, the body reacts accordingly.

Positive thoughts empower you, while negative ones can destroy you from within. On the conscious level, you can reason with and manipulate these thoughts. However, once they enter the subconscious, the dynamic shifts entirely. Escape or ignore them, you cannot.

Bringing thoughts from the subconscious to the conscious, and deliberately transferring them in the opposite direction, is challenging. It demands depth of thought, rigorous reasoning, and significant mental energy. This practice is known as 'mindfulness.'

The mind-body connection is a tangible and profound reality.
