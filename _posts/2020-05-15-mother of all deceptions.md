Have you ever wondered what happens while you dream? How does our brain create a reality, filled with such amazing details?

Consider this: while we dream, our brain creates a space for us—a space filled with every detail that makes it resemble a real world. The word 'real' should be used cautiously here. If you're visiting a supermarket in a dream, your brain constructs it with meticulous detail. You'll find a security guard at the entrance, a cashier at the counter, products on display, the color of the floor, the building's structure, the store's logo—every minute detail. Furthermore, you'll encounter random people you've never met in waking life, shopping in this dream supermarket. Your brain ensures you never question the dream's authenticity within the dream itself. This is the nightly deception our brain plays on us.

The question we must ask is: can we detect our brain's own deception? Considering that the brain is the only instrument we have to detect this deception, and it's also the very instrument orchestrating it, this becomes an incredibly difficult puzzle to solve. It's a deception of the highest order, the mother of all deceptions.
