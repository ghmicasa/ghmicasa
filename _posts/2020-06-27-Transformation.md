In a solitary phase, migratory locusts are generally green, camouflaged to blend with their background. They are normally less aggressive. However, when they grow up in crowded places, a strange mutation occurs: the swarming phase. They become darker and aggressive. In order to survive, when there is not enough food for all, they become destructive.

Humans are similar. In a world with limited resources, in order to satisfy themselves, they go through mutations, and, like swarming locusts, become destructive.

Like swarming locusts, humans cause destruction due to their adapted aggression. Exercising kindness and calmness is a human choice.

As a human, I intend to overcome this desire to retreat like a caterpillar and transform into something as beautiful as a butterfly.
