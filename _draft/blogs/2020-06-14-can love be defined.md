title: Can love be defined?
description: It’s a tricky question, and I think there isn’t a fixed definition of love. Love is hard to define, but it has many colors and can be broadly categorized into three categories. It’s an attempt, a fragile attempt. So, take it with a grain of salt!
accordion: 
  - title: Category 1
    content: I like to call it an accidental category. Here everything is accidental. Outcomes are random, but beautiful. Here emotions are riding high. Everything is emotional, and both the partners complement each other, emotionally. There is never a dull moment. Life feels like a discovery. New discoveries are made each and every moment.
  - title: Category 2
    content: I like to call it a ticking time bomb category. Here one is running high on emotions, and other one is there to fulfill personal purpose. Nothing is in right state here, as two different ideas collide, friction is always there, ugly outcomes are observed. It’s like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode one day.
  - title: Category 3
    content: I like to call it a mutual purpose fulfillment category. Here everything is based on give and take. Although nothing new is discovered, but all the purpose are fulfilled. Its smooth, every desires are fulfilled, and life-long friends are made.

Every category has beauty to it, and there is always a transition taking place, keeping the world dynamic and beautiful. There are many layers, but for now three broad categories will suffice.
