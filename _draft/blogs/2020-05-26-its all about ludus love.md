If we keep it casual, we will save ourselves from wasted time, desire, and self-respect. 

We all claim we are looking for pragma love, but in reality what we are searching for is ludus love.

It’s a play that you have to play every day, knowing the opponent is very good at it.

And the catch is, if you don’t keep it playful, you’ll end up losing the game.

The play that keeps us busy. Everyone of us is looking for a window of relief.

That’s love!
