title: Alternate reality - Lost in the loop.

I have reached down to my seat, 28C, and I am the last one to board this aircraft, like always. I let people settle down first, it feels less chaotic once everyone is in their seats. It’s an aisle seat, I prefer aisle because you get a better view of everything. Yes, you guessed it right, I am more interested in what is happening inside the aircraft than looking outside the window. Also, it’s an evening flight, and it makes no sense in occupying the window seat. <br/>

After settling down, I reach out for the flight safety manual, and it makes me smile. Today is our wedding anniversary, we have completed 9 years of our marriage, and she is the reason why I am smiling. When she is with me, she always pulls out safety manual, and hands it over to me. She always instructs with her mellifluous voice, “Just in case, you should know how to save me.” I pull out my phone to text her,<br/>

“There?” <br/>
“Yes” she replies, <br/>
“I think I’ll reach home by 9:30” <br/>
“Ok. Did you buy what I asked for?” <br/>
“Yes. I’ll call once I land.” <br/>
“Ok. Take care.” she ends the chat. <br/>

I put my phone in flight mode, and back in the pocket, and start reading the manual word by word understanding all the instructions. Although, I have read it several times, I re-read it to refresh and memorize instruction in every flight. For some reason, I even check for life jacket under the seat.<br/>

After finishing, I place the safety manual back, lean back in my seat, and try to absorb everything around me. <br/>

In my row a young kid is sitting in the window seat. He looks excited, probably flying for the first time. He has been talking to this old man sitting in the middle, since my arrival. Surely, they are related. I love the curiosity and energy of this child. The young lad reminds me of my son, Akash. I thought of texting Akash, but he rarely texts backs. He is a busy kid, reading novels all the time. He loves reading books, and is also a good photographer. I guess he picked up traits of me and my wife, equally. <br/>

In the seat in front of me, there is this young couple. All I hear is them giggling about something. I think this couple has just got married recently. You can tell this by looking at the hands of the girl, the palm is all designed with Mehndi, and the wrist is all covered with bangles, too many. This young couple reminds me of the days when I got married to my wife, Indu. She loves traditional wear. <br/>

To my right, across the aisle, I see a young gentleman, in his late twenties. He is on a call since I came here. I think he has been discussing some office work with his colleague, and I don’t think he’ll stop until an announcement is made by a flight attendant. Although, he is on a call, it doesn’t annoy me, there is a sophistication in his voice, and he’s been speaking in a very low pitch sound. <br/>

I hear the Captain making an announcement over the intercom, <br/>
“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. My name is Vishal. Welcome to Flight Number 6E-956, non-stop from Delhi to Mumbai. The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. The Chief flight attendant, Kanika, will now guide you through all the safety instruction.” <br/>

The chief flight attendant picks up the intercom and makes the usual announcement, <br/>
“Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Kanika and I’m your chief flight attendant. On behalf of Captain and the entire crew, welcome aboard Flight Number 6E-956, non-stop from Delhi to Mumbai. Our flight time will be about 2 hours and 15 minutes. The Captain has turned on the Fasten Seat Belt sign. If you haven’t already done so, please stow your carry-on luggage underneath the seat in front of you or in an overhead bin. Please take your seat and fasten your seat belt. And also make sure your seat back and folding trays are in their full upright position.” <br/>

She continues further, <br/>
“If you are seated next to an emergency exit, please read carefully the special instructions card located by your seat. If you do not wish to perform the functions described in the event of an emergency, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you.” <br/>

Next I see three crew members walking down the aisle, and stopping at their respective positions. They are now demonstrating all the safety instructions, and the chief flight attendant continues over the intercom and explains the emergency procedures to be used in emergencies. <br/>

She made the announcement in Hindi and English both. It’s funny, how she made Hindi sound like English. I mean she is an artist, she just introduced me to an extraordinary level of Hindi Language. Anyways, it’s a tough job. All jobs where you have to deal with the public is tough, I mean you always meet human exceptions, and it’s hard to deal with such people. <br/>

The Captain back on intercom and makes the announcement, <br/>
“We are second in priority for take-off, and we should depart in five minutes.” He pauses for a moment and then continues, <br/>
“Cabin crew, please take your seats for take-off.” <br/>

The next moment aircraft engines are in full throttle and we are accelerating rapidly on the runway. It’s funny how these aircrafts bump while running on a tarmac, it feels like we are all inside this giant lightweight cylindrical container made of some low grade plastic, but this isn’t true. These days fuselage is made of titanium and carbyne alloy, strongest material known to mankind, unlike earlier when some alloy of aluminum was used. There is no way this fuselage will ever break in pieces, I say it to myself, reassuring myself. <br/>

The plane has started to leave the ground, and we are now ascending in the air. The boy in the window seat has closed his eyes, and his hands are firmly holding the armrest. Definitely he is scared. Although aircrafts are the safest mode of transportation, but at this moment his fear is genuine. Most of the accidents occur during take-off or landing. In the industry, they call it plus three minus eight rule. The initial three minutes during take-off, and the last 8 minutes during landing are the riskiest time in an aircraft. Most of the accident occurs during this time only, and once you are past these few minutes, the chances of crashing down lowers dramatically. <br/>

The pilots have turned off the fasten seat belt sign. We have completed ascent successfully and all I see is a long queue to the toilet. I don’t know if it’s the fear that fills up their bladder, or they drank too much of water just before boarding the aircraft. Anyways, it’s a usual scene that you’ll see once pilots turns-off seat belt sign. I noticed there are five flight attendants, flight regulations require one attendant for 50 passengers. On this flight, there is an extra flight attendant, probably a trainee, I guess. <br/>

An attendant comes along with a trolley and asks,<br/>
“Good evening, sir, what would you like to have? Tea or coffee?” <br/>
“Coffee, black coffee please” <br/>
“Apologies Sir, I don’t have black coffee right now, but I’ll get it for you in while.”<br/>
“Sure. Thank you.” <br/>
I love black coffee, probably because it’s the only form where I can get the taste of coffee. Coffee mixed with milk isn’t what I prefer. <br/>
She goes on to perform the same action with each passenger in the row, asking and offering coffee and tea. It’s a tiring job. Such a monotony under monotony. People need to appreciate what these young girls do. <br/>

I wonder what happens to these girls when they get old, when they develop wrinkles on their skin, and gain weight. Probably they are relocated as ground staff. Whatever may be the reason, it’s a good practice to have young girls as a flight attendant. Personally, I feel, an active mind, and healthy body is necessary for a flight attendant. A fat lady with spondylitis will break her spinal cord in just one turbulence. <br/>

While I was lost in contemplating their life, the young attendant is back with coffee.<br/>
“Sir, here is your black coffee.”<br/>
“Thank you so much.” I replied.<br/>

I take a sip, and all I hear is whirring sound of massive aircraft engines, and people murmuring to each other, except three young boys sitting in the seats back of mine. I can hear them. May be their conversation is audible because they are seated very close to me, but their laugh is clearly noticed by everyone. They are all college students and going on a trip to Goa, and talking about all kinds of things. Their plan of going to some beach club, getting drunk and getting laid. <br/>

To save myself from their silly conversation, I asked the old man sitting next to me if I can borrow newspaper which he just finished reading.<br/>

“Do read the front page news about quantum experiment being conducted today.” He points my attention to front page while handing over newspaper. He continues further,<br/>
“We will be flying over the ground where this experiment is being conducted.” <br/>
“Hope the experiment doesn’t affect our flight.” <br/>
He ignores conversation, and turns back to the child to explain something. <br/>

I check for the date. It’s printed 16th December 2042. Yes, it’s today’s newspaper. It’s my habit to check for the date before reading any newspaper. It all started during my studies. There were weeks when I used to get very little time for reading newspapers, and when I used to get time for them, I used to read them in order. I go on to read the front page news that the old man explained about, to get a complete insight of the experiment. In fact, the news of experiment seems cover the half of the space in the newspaper. <br/>

The experiment is scheduled for 7:00 PM today. It will be conducted in the IQL, Indian quantum laboratory. The laboratory is located somewhere in a village Ropan in Rajasthan. The paper included a map along with the article to locate the laboratory. The old man said it right, we probably will be flying just over the laboratory. <br/>

The experiment involves colliding two massive particles which will create some kind of space-time distortion, producing something called de-coherent states. They are testing the many world theory propagated by Hugh Everett by studying the de-coherent states according to the paper. The article also talks about wormhole created during space-time distortion, the time travel, and the philosophical implications of experiment. <br/>

Scientists and political leaders all over the world sending their wishes, and their views on experiment is also covered. The paper also talked about the massive protest by some concerned citizens, and their fear of something going wrong. The metaphysical aspects of life and the Hindu philosophy of many worlds is also covered in an article. Today’s newspaper is really worth reading. <br/>

I give the newspaper back to the old man, and the old man asks enthusiastically, <br/>
“What do you think?” <br/>
“About what?” I reply back.<br/>
“The Experiment!” <br/>
“I hope it all goes well and scientist discover something new.” I reply as I have no idea what to say other than this. He chuckles and says, <br/>
“I know it will not go well, and the de-coherent states along with the wormhole will sustain for a long time, and it will change the idea about reality to this world.” <br/>
“What makes you think it will not go well?” I asked in my amusement, <br/>
“Because I calculated it.” <br/>
“You calculated?” I ask again, <br/>
“You see I am a quantum physicist, I studied the paper based on which this experiment is being conducted. I calculated and it’s not stable. The Experiment will throw us in the different version of this world.” <br/>
“Us? As in the entire world?” I ask to continue the interesting conversation, <br/>
“No! Just us, people in this aircraft” <br/>
“And why do you think it’s a good thing to happen to us?” I inquire further, <br/>
“Because of my grandchild. He can’t walk since his birth. I love him, and I want him to have a good life.” He continues further, <br/>
“I calculated everything, and I chose this flight.” He looks at his watch and continues, <br/>
“This flight will be right above the laboratory during the experiment.” He looks back at the watch hurriedly and continued further, <br/>
“Listen, think about something that you want in life. Think about something good, otherwise you will be lost in th…”<br/>
