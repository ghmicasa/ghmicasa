There was a time when people felt helpless when struck by the wrath of nature. Seeing loved ones disappear suddenly was not unusual, whenever an unknown disease silently entered into their lives. The Ayurvedic doctors of that time had to do something about it. They had to protect the lives of innocent people from the silent killers of nature. This short writing is dedicated to their commitment towards building a healthy society.

To understand you’ll have to go back in time, and see how history unfolded itself in the past. The entire land covered with dead bodies, doctors relentlessly working to save individuals suffering from disease, survivors leaving their piece of heart, this was a usual scene every time pandemic struck this land. Even today humans are helpless when nature changes its course of action towards elimination of lives.

The Ayurvedic doctors, despite all the challenges, they found different types of healthy food for human body. They found organic plants and seeds with antiseptic properties, and they used it extensively to cure human illness. They used it to develop human immunity to protect lives from silent killers. We are here, surviving all odds, is a testimony of their success.

You’ll have to give credit for their philosophical advancement also. They knew world is a dynamic place. There is always a philosophy out there to replace the old one. So, some individual, or some school of thought came up with an idea. Let them replace everything, but let’s pass on this already known idea of healthy living. Let’s make it an eating habit, and over the course of time this will become a taste. They will detach themselves with philosophy, but won’t be able to detach themselves with taste. This all that people in Indian subcontinent put in their food while cooking, is all bunch of antiseptic things provided by nature. And people here do it without even realizing it. They think it’s for taste. Yes, it’s for your tongue, the tongue trained over the years to develop a taste!
