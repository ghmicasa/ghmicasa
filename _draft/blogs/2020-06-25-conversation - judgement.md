title: Conversation - Judgement.
description: You cannot accuse me for making judgments. If you lied, that, itself, is a judgement done onto me. A decision of not telling me the truth or in your mind not finding me worth the truth, is a judgement. And the one who never had faith in me, do not have the right to question my faith in them. It’s a problem of losing faith in myself. As I lose faith in them, I lose faith in myself.

“Don’t judge me.”<br/>
“I never did.”<br/>
“Don’t peel off my mask.”<br/>
“I never did.”<br/>
“Then why are you peeling it now?”<br/>
“Because I am hurt.”<br/>
“No you aren’t.”<br/>
“Yes, I am.”<br/>
“No, you are not hurt, you just making judgements.”<br/>

“Hmm… if that is the case, we have no connection.”<br/>
“No. We have connection.”<br/>
“Still?”<br/>
“Yes!”<br/>
“What kind of connection?”<br/>
“Connection of someone enjoying someone’s misery.”<br/>
“Really?”<br/>
“Yes. This has always been the case, and I was mistaken to have had the hope of situation being different.”<br/>
“If you are hurt, and feel that way, then I must leave.”<br/>
“Yes. You should.”<br/>
“If I may ask, how you going to get back what you have lost?”<br/>
“I don’t know, yet I know.”<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“The species that has hurt is the only species that can fix it. That’s the catch, and the irony.”<br/>
“Hmm…”
