title: Is it the person or the memory that we remember?
description: In all types of human relations that we create with an individual, are we interested in the person or the experience that shapes our memory? To answer this, you’ll have to look into the evolution of human psychology.

In all types of human relations that we create with an individual, are we interested in the person or the experience that shapes our memory? 

To answer this, you’ll have to look into the evolution of human psychology. Everything that we experience are the direct consequence of the new information that our mind processes using the past knowledge/idea/or memory. These past memories/ideas/ or knowledges are also part of the same process. So, it’s fair to say, it’s a very dynamic process. 

How do we feel? 

Well, when the mind processes this ever-changing new information, either it aligns with the past information/idea/or knowledge or it collides with it. Depending upon the result, psychosomatic effects are felt between the mind and the body, especially the heart (an idea developed in literatures). So, our feelings and experiences are our memories.
We do not love an individual, but rather our memories. If that hadn’t been the case, most of the humans would be living life without love. We fall in love multiple times, because we keep on making new memories. 

An individual is just an object of our affection or the medium through which we create our memories. We feel the exact emotions which we want to create through our memories. Sometimes our creation is exactly as we had intended to create, and sometimes it’s something which we really fail to understand. It all depends on the dynamics between the two individuals and the circumstances surrounding them. How they communicate, reciprocate and understand the idea of two different creations wanting to become one.

So, live in the present moment and create new beautiful memories for your own future self, and whatever the memories that have been created in the past, either cherish them or learn from them. Move forward!
