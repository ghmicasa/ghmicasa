Sometimes we judge ourselves too harshly because of the situation which didn’t fructify as we desired, and this leads to a series of questioning. The questioning without an end, going in circles, leading to nowhere. The nowhere barren land.

No matter how much water you give, nothing will germinate on this land. The longer you keep yourself, the more you’ll feel thirsty. This arid land has seen many men thirsted to death. Are you willing to take such risk?

Don’t let your action take a path where nothing exists. Actions should come from the place of inspiration, and not from the place of judgement. So, let inspiration be the source of your action, and not judgment. Inspire yourself, achieve what is meant for you.
