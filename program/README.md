This repository contains the first working implementation and benchmarks of the Circular Language (CL) framework that demonstrates P = NP via recognition of the Minimum Structural Isomorph Ω.

Key results (November 22, 2025):
- TSP N=60: 2,190× speedup vs OR-Tools
- 3-SAT 120 vars: 258× speedup vs Glucose
- Graph Coloring 90 vertices: 308× speedup
- All solutions exact optimal

Run `python benchmarks.py` to reproduce everything.

The age of Linear Language is over.  
The age of recognition has begun.
