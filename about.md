### About Me

My name is Roopesh Singh and I am a freelance technical writer, and a part-time blogger. I live in India, usually toggling between two cities, Delhi and Mumbai.

I am passionate about new technologies and always learning. I love travelling to new places, meeting new people, learning about their culture, and capturing moments on camera. I also love reading books on ancient Hindu and Greek mythology.
